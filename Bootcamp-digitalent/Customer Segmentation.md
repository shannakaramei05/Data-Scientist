Overview : 

Target:
- make a better distribution for the customer 
- to know which product the customer like 
- profiling customer
- lower marketing costs

Method:
K-means Clustering
  => an unsupervised learning ( pattern data) algorithm that used for groping data based on variables.


  A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities
 (https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-6a6e67336aa1)

 we use kmeans when we dont know the output (label/class) from the data


 K-Means distance 
 - Euclidean distance
 - Manhattan distance
 - a squared eclidean distance measure
 - cosine distance measure
 - 

Objective:
-  approach ( centroid & distance)
-  Chossing appropriate K ( elbow method and Business specification)
-  Interpretaion ( cluster profilling)
-  goodness of fit ( within sum of squares, between sum of squares, total sum of squares)


Conclusion :
-Costumer segmentation is a important process used in bussiness for knowing the customer better
- with marketing process ( distribution) and CRM ( customer Relationship management) used more sharper. e.q.. optimum merketing in each segment with the optimal budget.
- to get the best segmentation we need to use computer algorithms
